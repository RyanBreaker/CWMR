# The Canton & West Marble Railroad

The Canton & West Marble Railroad (CWMR) is a fictional short-line transition-era railroad currently with trackage between East Whittier (Class-1 interchange) and Brooks with a spur to Alarka (WIP) at Alarka Junction.

The goal of this railroad is semi-serious with the goal of a fun and socially casual yet realistic operation.

## Operations
### Mainline
All mainline operations are directly controlled by the Dispatcher. Depending on availability and workload, CTC or ABS may be used at any time. The Dispatcher must announce to all current crews if a switch of signaling systems will occur. Regardless, trains must always run only as far as authorized by their current order as given by the Dispatcher regardless of system used.

Any spoken orders must be read back to the dispatcher; textual orders merely need to be verified as received.

For mainline movements, the head-end of a train should be turned to face the direction of travel when practicable and shoving movements should be minimized unless where necessary to complete a job.

### Headlights & Marker Lights
Headlights are to always be set to bright during movement on the mainline. Headlights are to be dimmed when involved in switching operations off the mainline, approaching another moving train (with the exception of simultaneous proximity to a grade crossing), or when stationary on the mainline, e.g. waiting for a meet.

When available, marker lights shall be set to red on the rear of a train. TODO: Front-end marker lights

### Engine Service
Engines should be serviced prior to each departure and tender levels frequently be checked to avoid a stranded situation. Coal chutes and water spouts are to be returned to their stowed position after servicing.

### Coupling & Separating
Coupling should ideally be performed at speeds between 2-3 mph. It is crucial to avoid coupling at speeds exceeding 5 mph, as doing so may lead to potential damage to the rolling stock being coupled.

Connecting the air is unnecessary when the existing train braking potential is more than sufficient to rapidly stop the train if necessary, such as when switching light or short cuts of cars. Connecting the air is strictly otherwise required.

Sufficient handbrakes must be set on cars left behind after decoupling, typically 1 being sufficient for light loads on level ground but more for heavier loads on grades.

## Definitions
### Conductor
The person who is in charge of the movement of a Train.

### Controlled Track
Track that must not be occupied or fouled without authority of the Dispatcher. All mainline and passing sidings trackage is considered Controlled Track.

### Dispatcher
The person having sole authority to issue orders and instructions governing the operation of trains on Controlled Track.

### Interchange
The location at which track is serviced by the hosting Class-1 railroad to deliver cars to industries along CWMR's trackage and take cars away from industries along CWMR's trackage back to the Interchange.

### Operator
The person who is responsible for the movement of a Train through direct manipulation of operating controls.

### Restricted Speed
Proceed prepared to stop within one-half the range of vision short of a Train, Engine, Rolling Stock, switches or derails not properly lined, opposing or converging traffic, persons or equipment on or in the foul of the track, obstructions, track defects or anything else that may require the Train to be stopped or its speed reduced. **Restricted Speed in no case is to exceed 20 MPH.**

### Yardmaster
The person having sole authority of movements into and within their respective yard.

## Whistle Signals

oooo
Call for signal.

-o
Approaching station.
